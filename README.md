# election-analysis
A tool for doing analysis on election results, in particular: (1) querying/filtering election results of past Presidential elections, (2) contrasting county, state, and national results to make predictions, find bellwethers, determine party loyalty, and (3) using Benford's Law to check for potentially fraudulent voting patterns.

Data used in this app was found at: https://electionlab.mit.edu/. Please see more of their work at https://github.com/MEDSL.
